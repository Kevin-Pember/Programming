- #Array
- Goal
	- We want to modify an array in place by rotating the items to the left k times
		- Rotation to the left
			- [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] → k = 3 → [3, 4, 5, 1, 2]
- Thinking behind the algorithm
	- The brute force version of this algorithm would have us moving each item over 1, k times which is very inefficient. Instead we can reverse the array multiple times. If we reverse the whole array such that its value is now [5, 4, 3, 2, 1] we then can split the array based on the k [%]([[modulo(%)]]) len(array) + 1 then rotate these two parts of the array again to accomplish this rotating

		  class Solution:
		      def rotate(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> None:
		          """
		          Do not return anything, modify nums in-place instead.
		          """
		          n = len(nums)
		          k %= n
		  
		          def reverse(left, right):
		              while left < right:
		                  nums[left], nums[right] = nums[right], nums[left]
		                  left += 1
		                  right -= 1
		          
		          reverse(0, n - 1)
		          reverse(0, k - 1)
		          reverse(k, n - 1)
		  ```
