- #Array #[[Two Pointer]] #[[Greedy Algorithm]]
- Goal
	- Given an array of heights of walls in a container return the maximum amount of water that can be stored in the container
- Thinking Behind the Algorithm
	- Using a two pointer approach, left and right, we can close in on the walls in the array from 0 and n - 1. Each time we can calculate the maximum water that can be stored between our left and right walls then advancing either the left or right pointer depending on which is smaller. We can then break the loop once left and right are equal.
