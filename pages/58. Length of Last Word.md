- #[[String]]
- Goal
	- We are given a string and we need to return the length of the last word in the string
- Thinking Behind the Algorithm
	- The last word may be separated by a long whitespace from the end of the string so we need to find the end of the last string by traversing from the back of the string until we find a character that is not whitespace then we further traverse the string until we find another whitespace character then subtract  the start from the end
- Implementation
	- [[C++ Implementation]]
		- ```
		  class Solution {
		  public:
		      int lengthOfLastWord(string s) {
		          int end = s.length() - 1;
		          
		          while(end >= 0 && s[end] == ' '){
		              end--;
		          }
		          int start = end;
		          while (start >= 0 and s[start] != ' '){
		              start--;
		          }
		          return end - start;
		      }
		  };
		  ```
