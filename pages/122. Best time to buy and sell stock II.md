- #[[Greedy Algorithm]] #[[121. Best time to buy and sell stock]] #Array
- Goal
	- Similar to the first we are given an array of prices of subsequent days but this time we have unlimited buying and selling. We need to return the max profit over the whole array
- Thinking behind the Algorithm
	- Considering we want an optimal profit for the whole array, we can choose the locally optimal choice every time in a [[Greedy Algorithm]]
