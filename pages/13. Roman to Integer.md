- #String #Dictionary/Map #Math
- Goal
	- Given a [[String]] of Roman numerals return the integer that string represents
- Thinking Behind the Algorithm
	- We can use a [[Dictionary/Map]] to translate roman numerals to the integers they represent but we run into an issue of how roman numerals work. The system uses prefixes of smaller numbers that subtract from their larger subsequent values. For example 4 is IV which is the numeral for 1 followed by the numeral for 5. We can emulate this system though keeping a the previous value added to the integer so that we can subtract for the integer value. With this logic it makes more sense to traverse the [[String]] from right to left as the roman numeral system operates on a system where leftmost values are the largest, meaning we can just subtract from the [[Integer]] value if the current numeral is smaller than the previous numeral.

		  class Solution:
		      def romanToInt(self, s: str) -> int:
		          count = 0
		          previous = 0
		          translate = {
		              "I": 1, 
		              "V": 5, 
		              "X": 10, 
		              "L": 50,
		              "C": 100,
		              "D": 500,
		              "M": 1000
		          }
		          for i in range(len(s) - 1, -1, -1):
		              value = translate[s[i]]
		              count += value if previous <= value else -value
		              previous = value
		          return count
