- #Array #[[Prefix Sum]]
- Goal
	- We are given an array of numbers and we need to return an array where the value at any given index is the product of the numbers in the array excluding the number at that index in the original array. You can't use division and it has to run in O(N) Time
- Thinking behind the Algorithm
	- First we need to Initialize an array with the length of the given array and has a value of 1 in every index. Now think about any given index, it is the product of all the numbers to is left product and the numbers to its right product. We can use this idea to keep our Algorithm in O(n). First we will traverse our array from left to right assigning each index the product of all values to the left. Then we till traverse from right to left doing the same. Then all we need to do is return the array

		- ```
		  class Solution:
		      def productExceptSelf(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[int]:
		          n = len(nums)
		          output = [1] * n
		          left = 1
		          for i in range(n):
		              output[i] *= left
		              left *= nums[i]
		          
		          right = 1
		          for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
		              output[i] *= right
		              right *= nums[i]
		          return output
