- #Dynamic_Programming
- Goal
	- We want to modify an array in place by rotating the items to the left k times
		- Rotation to the left
			- [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] → k = 3 → [3, 4, 5, 1, 2]
- Thinking behind the algorithm
	- The brute force version of this algorithm would have us moving each item over 1, k times which is very ineffcient
