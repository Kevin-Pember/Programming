- #Boyer-Moore_majority_vote_algorithm
- Goal
	- find and return the element that occurs in more than half of the array
- Thinking behind the Algorithm
	- This problem is basically made for the #Boyer-Moore_majority_vote_algorithm which is matches the specifications perfectly. Essentially we want to have a Candidate (majorIndex) and a Count (majorCount). Whenever we encounter our candidate we increment our count and whenever we see any other number we decrement count. Once count is zero set the candidate to the
