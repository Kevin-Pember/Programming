- #Array
- Goal
	- We need to find a Researcher's H-Index which is the H number of papers that have an H number of citations. We are given an integer array, each index represents one paper and its value is its number of citations
- Thinking behind the Algorithm
	- If we sort the array we can make use the index to calculate the number of papers with the same or more citations. So we want to check if the number of citations at a given position is >= length - index
- Implementation
	- Python
