- #Array #String
- Goal
	- Given a string reverse the order of the words in the string
- Thinking behind the Algorithm
	- We need to break up a [[String]] into an [[Array]] then reverse the [[Array]] and combine it back into a string.
- Implementation
	- [[Python Implementation]]
		- ```
		  class Solution:
		      def reverseWords(self, s: str) -> str:
		          a = s.split()
		          a.reverse()
		          return " ".join(a)
		  ```

		- TODO Implement a C++ version of the function with stringstream for an example on its use
