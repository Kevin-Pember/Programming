- #Array #[[Greedy Algorithm]]
- Goal
	- We are given a list of rankings of Children and We need to return the amount of candy we need to give them based on the rules
	- Rules
		- 1. Each Child must have at least one candy
		- 2. Children with higher ratings get more candy then their neighbors
- Thinking behind the Algorithm
	- We need to use a [[Greedy Algorithm]] to give the optimal  amount of candy for each kid. Each kid has two neighbors to their left and right meaning that we have to do two passes to ensure that we satisfy the second rule. First we initialize an array of candies given to each child, this will be a n length array were every position is 1 to satisfy rule 1. Then we need to make our first pass which will be left to right where we will increase candies at any  i if that child's rating is greater than the child at i - 1. After this we will do our second pass where we traverse our array from right to left, at each position checking if i is greater than i  + 1, if it is rather then blindly incrementing it (as we did in the first pass) we want to check the incremented version against the value we had from the first pass, whichever is higher is the count we pick. We then can add the count at i to our candy count. Then all we need to do is return the count + the last position in our created array as the second pass ignored this value
