- #Array
- Goal
	- We want to return a boolean value weather we can make it through an array using each value as the distance we can move from each index.
- Thinking Behind the Algorithm
	- We can traverse the array and keep a max_i with is the maximum I we can get to from any jump. If i exceeds max_i we can immediately return False, if max_i exceeds the length of the array we can return True immediately otherwise if we reach the end of the loop
