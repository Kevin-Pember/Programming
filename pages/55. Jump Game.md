- #Array
- Goal
	- We want to return a boolean value weather we can make it through an array using each value as the distance we can move from each index.
- Thinking Behind the Algorithm
	- We can traverse the array and keep a max_i with is the maximum I we can get to from any jump. If i exceeds max_i we can immediately return False, if max_i exceeds the length of the array we can return True immediately otherwise if we reach the end of the loop we can just return True
- Implementation
	- [[Python Implementation]]
		- ```
		  class Solution:
		      def canJump(self, nums: List[int]) -> bool:
		          n = len(nums)
		          max_i = nums[0]
		          for i in range(1, n):
		              if i > max_i: return False
		              if n <= max_i: return True
		              max_i = max(max_i, i + nums[i])
		          return True
		  ```
