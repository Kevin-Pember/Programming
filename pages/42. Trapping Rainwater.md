- #Array #[[Two Pointer]]
- Goal
	- Given an array of heights of walls determine the amount of water trapped in the ridges of the wall
- Thinking behind the Algorithm
	- Lets consider how we would calculate the water height at any given position. Any i is limited by the lower of the highest wall to either its left or its right. So what can we do with this, well we could create a max_left and max_right array which at any given i have the max wall height to its left and right respectively. The implementation is fine both has an O(N) space complexity which we can do better. Lets think about what we actually need. At each i we allocate memory for the higher of the two walls even though its only used to tell which of walls is the lower. But lets think about a two pointer version of our implementation. We can have a left and a right position and in combonation we can have a variable to store the max_h
