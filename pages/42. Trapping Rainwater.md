- Goal
	- Given an array of heights of walls determine the amount of water trapped in the ridges of the wall
- Thinking behind the Algorithm
	- Lets consider how we would calculate the water height at any given position. Any i is limited by the lower of the highest wall to either its left or its right. So what can we do with this information
