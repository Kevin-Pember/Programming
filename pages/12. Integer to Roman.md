- #String #[[Dictionary/Map]] #[[13. Roman to Integer]] #Math
- Goal
	- Convert an Integer value to a roman numeral string
- Thinking behind the Algorithm
	- Considering the last problem we can understand that we should use a [[Dictionary/Map]] or a key value pair data structure. But we can't use our previous approach to find the prefix cases so we have to include them in our [[Dictionary/Map]]. What do we do will our key value pairs, well we can use integer division on our given integer with the numeric component of the pair to find the amount of an symbol in our roman representation. So we can traverse our translation [[Dictionary/Map]] doing this and decrementing the given number
