- Goal
	- We need to return the max profit given an array of prices of a stock during consecutive days. We can only buy and sell once.
- Thinking Behind the Algorithm
	- The brute force method would have us check all subsequent prices after any stock buy price resulting in a n^2 algorithm but we can modify Kadane's Algorithm to solve it more efficiently.  With the variables buy_price and max_profit we can find a minimum buy price and the maximum profit for subsequent prices
- Implementation
	- [[Javascript Implementation]]
		- ```
		  /**
		   * @param {number[]} prices
		   * @return {number}
		   */
		  var maxProfit = function(prices) {
		      let buy_price = prices[0]
		      let profit = 0
		  
		      for(let i = 1; i < prices.length; i++){
		          buy_price = Math.min(buy_price, prices[i])
		          profit = Math.max(profit, prices[i] - buy_price)
		      }
		      return profit
		  };
		  ```
- Image to remember
	- TODO create a image for best time to buy and sell stock
