- #Array #Greedy_Algorithm #[[Kadane's_Algorithm]]
- Goal
	- We need to return the max profit given an array of prices of a stock during consecutive days. We can only buy and sell once.
- Thinking Behind the Algorithm
	- The brute force method would have us check all subsequent prices after any stock buy price resulting in a n^2 algorithm but we can modify Kadane's Algorithm to solve it more efficiently.  With the variables buy_price and max_profit we can find a minimum buy price and the maximum profit for subsequent prices
- Implementation
	- Python
