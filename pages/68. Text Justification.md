- Goal
	- We are given the array words and an integer called maxWidth. We need to return an array of strings were each string has a length of maxWidth, fitting as many words in a line and evenly distributing whitespace filling up the rest of the line. This holds for all of the lines except the last line which should be left justified, meaning one space between words and the rest of the whitespace at the end
	- Example:
		- **Input:** ``words = ["This", "is", "an", "example", "of", "text", "justification."]``, ``maxWidth = 16``
		- **Output:**
			- ```
			  [
			     "This    is    an",
			     "example  of text",
			     "justification.  "
			  ]
			  ```
- Thinking behind the Algorithm
	- We want to loop through the array and assemble each line as we reach a point where we can no longer add words to a line. Each word we need to consider its length and the minimum whitespace to separate it from its neighbors. Once we fill a line we need find how many whitespace characters we need to fill the the rest of the line we then need to describe these spaces evenly so we need to keep track of how many spaces need to be filled. This method also lends itself to the left justified last line as it won't compile it leading to a second loop that will compile the last line
