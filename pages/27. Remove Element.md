- #in-place #[[Two Pointer]] #Array
- Goal
	- We want to remove all instances of an integer in an array. We also want to modify the array directly and return an integer of how many items the array has after removal
- Thinking Behind the Algorithm
	- Using a two pointer system one that traverses the indices of the array (i) and one that keeps track of number of remaining elements (count). While using i to check if the value at that position doesn't match the remove element setting the index at count's current value to the value at i we effectively modify it in place
- Implementation
	- Python
		- ```
		  def removeElement(self, nums: List[int], val: int) -> int:
		          count = 0
		          for i in range(len(nums)):
		              if nums[i] != val:
		                  nums[count] = nums[i]
		                  count += 1
		          return count
		  ```
