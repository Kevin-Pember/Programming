- #[[Two Pointer]] #In-place #[[23. Remove Duplicates from sorted Array]] #Array
- Goal
	- The difference from part one is that values are allowed at most 2 instances of a value can be in the unique section
- Thinking behind the Algorithm
	- Basically the same implementation as the first part but check the unique index at the second to last index rather then the last
- Implementation
	- [[Python]]
		- ```
		  def removeDuplicates(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
		          unique = 1
		          for i in range(2, len(nums)):
		              if nums[unique - 1] != nums[i]:
		                  unique += 1
		                  nums[unique] = nums[i]
		          return unique + 1
		  ```
