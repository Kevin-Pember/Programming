- #[[Two Pointer]] #In-place #Array
- Goal
	- This problem wants to merge two sorted arrays nums1 & nums2 in place. Meaning nums1 has allocated space for both itself and the values in nums2
- Thinking Behind the algorithm
	- Using a two pointer approach we can aim pointers at the at the end last values of nums1 and nums2 which due to their non decreasing order makes the values they point to the largest in their respective arrays. Using this cocept we can move the larger of the two values to the end of nums1 then repeating this until nums2 has no more values. This will result in a merged array in the nums1 array
- Implementation
	- [[Python]]
		- ```
		  def merge(self, nums1: List[int], m: int, nums2: List[int], n: int) -> None:
		         	head1 = m -1
		          head2 = n - 1
		          i = m + n - 1
		          while head2 >= 0:
		              print(nums1[head1],"vs.",nums2[head2])
		              if head1 >= 0 and nums1[head1] > nums2[head2]:
		                  nums1[i] = nums1[head1]
		                  head1 -= 1
		              else:
		                  nums1[i] = nums2[head2]
		                  head2 -= 1
		              print("Index",i,"is now =",nums1[i])
		              i -= 1
		  ```
