- Goal
	- This problem wants to merge two sorted arrays nums1 & nums2 in place. Meaning nums1 has allocated space for both itself and the values in nums2
- Thinking Behind the algorithm
	- Using a two pointer approach we can aim pointers at the at the end last values of nums1 and nums2 which due to their non decreasing order
