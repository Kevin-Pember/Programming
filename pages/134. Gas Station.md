- #Array #[[Greedy Algorithm]]
- Goal
	- We are given two arrays gas and cost. Gas is the gas you get at every index and Cost is the cost (in gas) to get to i +   1. We will go in a cycle, return a index to start at in which you are able to complete the loop, return -1 if you can't complete the loop
- Thinking behind the algorithm
	- First off we know that if our sum cost is greater than or sum gas we known that the cycle cannot be completed so we can return our -1 in this case. Otherwise we can use two variables **start** (denoting where we will start our cycle) and **surplus** (which with keep track of the gas we have remaining). We want to use a [[Greedy Algorithm]] to determine if it is possible to make it to the next gas station (if surplus is greater than zero) if its not we can set our start to the index after the head. This way once the loop finishes checking every value we will have selected the optimal start
- Implementation
	- [[Python]]
		- ```
		  class Solution:
		      def canCompleteCircuit(self, gas: List[int], cost: List[int]) -> int:
		          if sum(gas) < sum(cost):
		              return -1
		          n = len(gas)
		          surplus, start = 0, 0
		          for i in range(n):
		              surplus += gas[i] - cost[i]
		              if surplus < 0:
		                  surplus = 0
		                  start = i + 1
		          return start
		  ```
