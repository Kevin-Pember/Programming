- #Array #[[Greedy Algorithm]]
- Goal
	- We are given two arrays gas and cost. Gas is the gas you get at every index and Cost is the cost (in gas) to get to i +   1. We will go in a cycle, return a index to start at in which you are able to complete the loop, return -1 if you can't complete the loop
- Thinking behind the algorithm
	- First off we know that if our sum cost is greater than or sum gas we known that the cycle cannot be completed so we can return our -1 in this case. Otherwise we can use two variables **start** (denoting where we will start our cycle) and **surplus** (which with keep track of the gas we have remaining). Similar
