- #Array #[[Dictionary - Python]] #Hashmap
- Goal
	- Create an object RandomizedSet which has the methods Insert, Delete, and GetRandom which all have on average an O(1) runtime. Insert and Delete return Boolean values based on whether the value is already in the set or not
- Thinking Behind the Algorithm
	- The problem behind this question is that no one data structure can accomplish these goals on its own. An [[Array]]  can't check if a value is in it in O(1) time. While [Dictionaries]([[Dictionary - Python]]) and [Sets]([[Set - Python]]) hash map implementation means they cant have random accesses. We can use an Array in combonatin with a [Dictionary]([[Dictionary - Python]])
