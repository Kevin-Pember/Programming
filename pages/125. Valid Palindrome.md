- #[[Two Pointer]] #String
- Goal
	- Given a string return a Boolean depending on whether the string, removing all non-alphanumeric characters, is a valid Palindrome
- Thinking behind the Algorithm
	- A [[Two Pointer]] approach works rather well for this problem. With is we can have a pointer at the front and one at the back. Depending on if both characters are alphanumeric we can check the two values, making sure to sanitize them by converting them to lowercase letters. All of this would be in a loop which would end when the left and right pointers meet. We would return True once this loop was over and false if any alphanumeric characters didn't match.
- Implementation
	- [[Python Implementation]] #card

		  class Solution:
		      def isPalindrome(self, s: str) -> bool:
		          l = 0
		          r = len(s) - 1
		  
		          while l < r:
		              if not s[l].isalnum():
		                  l += 1
		                  continue
		              if not s[r].isalnum():
		                  r -= 1
		                  continue
		              if s[r].lower() != s[l].lower():
		                  return False
		              l += 1
		              r -= 1
		          return True
