- #Array #[[Greedy Algorithm]] #[[Sliding Window]] #[[55. Jump Game]]
- Goal
	- Rather then find if we can get though the array this problem wants us to find the minimum number of jumps we have to make to get across the array
- Thinking Behind the algorithm
	- We can use a [[Greedy Algorithm]] to get the general optimal solution we also
- Implementation
	- ```
	  class Solution:
	      def jump(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
	          n = len(nums)
	          if n <= 1: return 0
	          near = far = min_jumps = 0
	          while far < n - 1:
	              farthest = 0
	              for i in range(near, far + 1):
	                  farthest = max(farthest, i + nums[i])
	              near = far + 1
	              far = farthest
	              min_jumps += 1
	          return min_jumps
