- #Array #[[Greedy Algorithm]] #[[Sliding Window]] #[[55. Jump Game]]
- Goal
	- Rather then find if we can get though the array this problem wants us to find the minimum number of jumps we have to make to get across the array
- Thinking Behind the algorithm
	- For our [[Sliding Window]] we want to create near and far variables in which are initialized at zero and are modified by a loop that depends on whether far has reached the end of the array. In this loop we want to create another variable called farthest which stores the farthest jump in our window which is the local optimal choice making it a [[Greedy Algorithm]] . We then set near to far + 1 and far to farthest while finally incrementing min_jumps.

		  class Solution:
		      def jump(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
		          n = len(nums)
		          if n <= 1: return 0
		          near = far = min_jumps = 0
		          while far < n - 1:
		              farthest = 0
		              for i in range(near, far + 1):
		                  farthest = max(farthest, i + nums[i])
		              near = far + 1
		              far = farthest
		              min_jumps += 1
		          return min_jumps
