- #[[Array]] #[[String]]
- Goal
	- Given an array of strings find the longest shared prefix among all the strings
- Thinking behind the Algorithm
	- Considering the prefix needs to be in all of the strings we could use the first string in the array and shrink it until it becomes the longest common prefix. So we would need to check the prefix against each string and cut it down if it doesn't match then returning the cut down string
- Implementation
	- [[C++ Implementation]]

- Image to Remember
	- TODO create an image to remember longest common prefix
