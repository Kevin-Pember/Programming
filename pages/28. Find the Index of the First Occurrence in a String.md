- #[[Two Pointer]] #String #[[String Matching]]
- Goal
	- Given two strings needle and haystack return the index of the first occurrence of needle in haystack or -1 if needle is not in haystack
- Thinking behind the Algorithm
	- Lets think about how many possible substrings of haystack that can contain needle. Its limited to how how many indices longer haystack is longer thank needle. So to search through haystack we can start at 0 and end at this difference then checking the substring of haystack that is then length of needle
- Implementation
	- [[Python Implementation]]
		- ```
		  class Solution {
		  public:
		      int strStr(string haystack, string needle) {
		          if(haystack.length() < needle.length()){
		              return -1;
		          }
		          for(int i = 0; i <= haystack.length() - needle.length(); ++i){
		              if (haystack.substr(i, needle.length()) == needle){
		                  return i;
		              }
		          }
		          return -1;
		      }
		  };
		  ```
- Image to Remember
	- TODO create an image to remember first occurrence in string
