- #[[Two Pointer]] #String #[[Dynamic Programming]]
- Goal
	- Given two strings return if s is a subsequence of t
- Thinking behind the Algorithm
	- Considering that we are looking for sub sequence inside of t we need to traverse t with a for loop. The index of this loop will be considered one of our pointers, our second pointer will point to the character we are looking for in S. Once we find a character of s in t we can then advance this pointer. We then return true if the s pointer reaches the length of s and false it t pointer reaches the length of t

		  class Solution {
		  public:
		      bool isSubsequence(string s, string t) {
		          if (s.length() == 0) return true; 
		          int frontS = 0;
		          for(int i = 0; i < t.length(); ++i){
		              if(s[frontS] == t[i]){
		                  ++frontS;
		              }
		              if(s.length() == frontS){
		                  return true;
		              }
		          }
		          return false;
		      }
